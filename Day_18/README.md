# Day 18 – NumPy Advanced Operations

## Topics Covered
- NumPy Broadcasting
- Mathematical Functions
- Statistical Operations using axis
- Mini Practice Problems

## Key Learnings
- Broadcasting removes the need for loops
- axis=0 works column-wise, axis=1 works row-wise
- Normalization is essential in Machine Learning
