# Day 13 – Python OOP (Intermediate)

## Topics Covered
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction using abc module

## Files
- `oop_concepts.py` → Inheritance & method overriding
- `abstraction_shape.py` → Abstract base class example
- `employee_system.py` → Mini project using all OOP concepts

## Key Learnings
- Used `super()` for constructor chaining
- Implemented abstract methods using `ABC`
- Applied polymorphism through common method calls

## Outcome
Built real-world OOP structures similar to those used in data pipelines and ML systems.
