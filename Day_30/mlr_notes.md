# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

## What is Multiple Linear Regression?
Multiple Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable using **more than one independent variable**.

It extends Simple Linear Regression by allowing multiple input features.

## Mathematical Equation
y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + ... + βnxn

Where:
- y = dependent variable
- x1, x2, x3... = independent variables
- β0 = intercept
- β1, β2... = coefficients

## Simple vs Multiple Linear Regression
- Simple Linear Regression uses **one** feature
- Multiple Linear Regression uses **multiple** features
- MLR captures more complex real-world relationships

## Real-Life Example
House Price Prediction:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Age of house
- Distance from city center

All these features together affect the house price.

## Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression
1. Linearity  
2. No multicollinearity  
3. Homoscedasticity  
4. Normality of errors  
5. Independence of observations

## Interview Tip
MLR works well when relationships are linear and features are not highly correlated.
