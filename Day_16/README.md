# Day 16: NumPy Basics

## What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for fast numerical and mathematical operations. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and is the core library used in Data Science.

## Why NumPy is Important
- Faster than Python lists
- Supports vectorized operations
- Uses less memory
- Backbone of Pandas, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
