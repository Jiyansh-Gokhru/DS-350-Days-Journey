# Day 25 – Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival
on the Titanic using advanced exploratory data analysis techniques.

## Key Questions
- Does age affect survival chances?
- Is there a relationship between fare paid and survival?
- How do gender and passenger class impact survival?
- Are there any strong correlations between features?

## Key Insights
- Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival rates.
- Female passengers survived significantly more than males.
- First-class passengers had the highest survival probability.
- Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
- Passenger class and fare show strong negative correlation.
- Survival is positively correlated with fare and negatively with passenger class.

## Conclusion
Survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by socio-economic factors such as gender,
passenger class, and fare paid. These insights highlight the importance of feature
relationships and exploratory analysis before applying machine learning models.
