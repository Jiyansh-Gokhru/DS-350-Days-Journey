# Day 07 – Python Tuples & Sets

## Topics Covered
- Python Tuples
- Tuple indexing, slicing
- Tuple immutability
- Tuple methods and unpacking
- Python Sets
- Set methods
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

## Key Differences
- List: Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates
- Tuple: Ordered, immutable, allows duplicates
- Set: Unordered, mutable, no duplicates

## Practice Programs
- Tuple creation and access
- Tuple unpacking
- Counting and indexing elements
- Set add/remove operations
- Set operations
- Removing duplicates using sets
