# Day 24 – Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

## What I Learned
- How to create basic plots using Matplotlib (line, bar, histogram, scatter)
- How Seaborn simplifies statistical visualization
- How to visualize data to extract insights, not just make plots

## Matplotlib vs Seaborn
- **Matplotlib**: Low-level, highly customizable, more code
- **Seaborn**: High-level, cleaner visuals, built on top of Matplotlib
- Seaborn is better for EDA and quick insights

## Titanic Dataset – Key Insights
1. Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) had higher survival counts
2. Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate
3. Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive

## Key Takeaway
Visualization is not about charts — it’s about answering questions from data.
