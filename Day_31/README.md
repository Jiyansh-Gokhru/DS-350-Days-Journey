# Polynomial Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates Polynomial Regression to model non-linear
relationships between features and target variables.

Polynomial Regression extends Linear Regression by transforming input
features into polynomial features.

## Dataset
A simple synthetic non-linear dataset was used to clearly understand
the working of Polynomial Regression.

## Concepts Covered
- Polynomial Regression
- PolynomialFeatures from sklearn
- Linear Regression on transformed features
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Overfitting intuition

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

Polynomial Regression performed better than simple Linear Regression
for non-linear data.

## Key Learnings
- Polynomial Regression is linear in parameters
- Higher-degree polynomials can overfit
- Feature transformation enables non-linear learning

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
