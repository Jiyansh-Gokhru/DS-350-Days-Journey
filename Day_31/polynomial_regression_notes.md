# Polynomial Regression – Notes

## What is Polynomial Regression?
Polynomial Regression is used when the relationship between the independent
variable (X) and dependent variable (y) is non-linear.

Instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a curve.

## Polynomial Regression Equation
y = b0 + b1x + b2x² + ... + bnxⁿ

## Is Polynomial Regression Linear?
Yes.
Polynomial Regression is still a Linear Regression model because it is linear
with respect to the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, ...).

## Why not use Linear Regression?
Linear Regression fails when data has a curved pattern.
Polynomial Regression captures non-linear relationships.

## When to Use Polynomial Regression
- Data shows a curved trend
- Linear model gives poor performance
- Relationship is non-linear but smooth

## Risk of Polynomial Regression
- High degree polynomial can cause overfitting
- Model may perform well on training data but poorly on test data
