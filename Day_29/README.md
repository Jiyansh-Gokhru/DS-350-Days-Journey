# Linear Regression – California Housing Price Prediction

## Objective
To understand and implement **Linear Regression** using scikit-learn and evaluate its performance on a real-world housing dataset.

---

## Dataset Used
- California Housing Dataset  
- Target variable: `median_house_value`
- Features include housing, population, and location-related attributes.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Performed train-test split
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn
4. Made predictions on test data
5. Evaluated model using standard regression metrics

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average absolute prediction error
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Penalizes large errors
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Error in original units
- **R² Score** – Explains variance captured by the model

---

## Key Learnings
- Linear Regression is a strong **baseline model**
- Model interpretability is a major advantage
- Performance depends heavily on data quality and assumptions
- Not suitable for non-linear relationships

---

## Conclusion
Linear Regression provides a simple yet powerful way to model relationships between variables and is widely used in industry for baseline comparisons and interpretability.
