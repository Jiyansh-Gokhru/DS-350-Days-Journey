# Day 33 – Regularization Techniques

## Topics Covered
- Overfitting & Regularization
- Ridge Regression (L2)
- Lasso Regression (L1)
- Elastic Net Regression

---

## Key Learnings
- Regularization reduces overfitting by penalizing large coefficients
- Ridge shrinks coefficients but keeps all features
- Lasso performs automatic feature selection
- Elastic Net combines stability and sparsity
