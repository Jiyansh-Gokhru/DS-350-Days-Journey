# Day 23 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset
Titanic sample dataset with 8 rows and 6 columns.

Columns:
- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- Fare

## Analysis Performed
- Basic dataset inspection (head, info, describe)
- Univariate analysis on numerical columns (Age, Fare)
- Univariate analysis on categorical columns (Sex, Pclass, Survived)

## Key Insights
1. The dataset contains missing values in the Age column.
2. Most passengers belong to Passenger Class 3.
3. Male passengers are more than female passengers.
4. The Fare column shows a wide range of values, indicating possible skewness.
5. The survival count is lower than the non-survival count.
6. Age values range from very young (2 years) to older adults (54 years).

## Conclusion
Basic EDA helps in understanding the structure, quality, and distribution of data before cleaning and modeling.
