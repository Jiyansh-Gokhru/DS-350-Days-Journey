# Day 04 – Python Loops

## Topics Learned
- For loops
- While loops
- `range()` function
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Infinite loops (concept)

## Programs Completed

### Using `for` loops
1. Print numbers 1 to 10
2. Print numbers 10 to 1
3. Print even numbers from 1 to 100
4. Print odd numbers from 1 to 100

### Using `while` loops
5. Sum of first n natural numbers
6. Multiplication table of a number
7. Factorial of a number
8. Count digits in a number
9. Reverse a number
10. Simple password check

## Reflection
- Loops are now clear and easy to use.
- Some problems like **digit count** were tricky at first, but now fully understood.
- Practicing both `for` and `while` loops strengthened logical thinking.
